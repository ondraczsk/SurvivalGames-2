The Request:

can u make an sg plugin ?
a stable one
all sg plugins out there aren't stable and each one has a major issue
just make it simple  .with chest refill system. 24 players join the game with a sign and once the 5 minutes is done all remaining players get teleported to the deathmatch spawn and the last player alive wins . without no kits . only items in chests . u can make the items optional if u want or just make it generate random items each time it refills the chests .
